To summarize, the Lean Web Principles are...

1. Embrace the Platform
2. Small & Modular
3. The Web is for Everyone

If you remember nothing else from this book, I want you to remember to think like a dev dinosaur and embrace old, stable, boring technologies and techniques.

More bikes, fewer cars.

If this sort of thing is interesting to you, I share lean web code snippets, tools, techniques and more every weekday at GoMakeThings.com.^[[https://gomakethings.com](https://gomakethings.com)] You can also find a collection of lean web resources on this site.

Together, we can build a simpler, faster world wide web.
